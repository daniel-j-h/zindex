# ZIndex

Proof of concept for a very fast cloud-native static spatial index for 2D points based on a Z-Order space filling curve and BIGMIN search space pruning.

- See the `index.py` file for creating the .parquet file from an .osm.pbf file
- See the `query.py` file as an example for querying the .parquet file

Thanks to [Marco Neumann](https://github.com/crepererum) helping me understand Parquet.


## Usage

I have generated the file `berlin-latest-hydrants.parquet` and have a GitHub Page serve it

```bash
python3 index.py berlin-latest.osm.pbf -o berlin-latest-hydrants.parquet
```

This means we can make queries against it with DuckDB for testing purpose

```sql
select
  z, lng, lat
from
  'https://daniel-j-h.github.io/zindex/berlin-latest-hydrants.parquet'
limit 5;
```

|     z      |    lng     |    lat     |
|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| 3771284411 | 2304120872 | 3397430539 |
| 3771284411 | 2304121287 | 3397430532 |
| 3771284411 | 2304139434 | 3397429778 |
| 3771284414 | 2304154532 | 3397429503 |
| 3771296433 | 2307284277 | 3397201896 |


## How It Works

We sort 2d points along a Z-order space-filling curve and use an optimization ("BIGMIN") to skip over irrelevant data when walking the curve.
